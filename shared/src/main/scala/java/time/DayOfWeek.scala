/** A day-of-week, such as 'Tuesday'.
  *
  * {@code DayOfWeek} is an enum representing the 7 days of the week -
  * Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
  *
  * In addition to the textual enum name, each day-of-week has an {@code int} value.
  * The {@code int} value follows the ISO-8601 standard, from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday).
  * It is recommended that applications use the enum rather than the {@code int} value
  * to ensure code clarity.
  *
  * This enum provides access to the localized textual form of the day-of-week.
  * Some locales also assign different numeric values to the days, declaring
  * Sunday to have the value 1, however this class provides no support for this.
  * See {@link WeekFields} for localized week-numbering.
  *
  * <b>Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code DayOfWeek}.
  * Use {@code getValue()} instead.</b>
  *
  * This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
  * As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the day-of-week
  * concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO calendar system.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.
