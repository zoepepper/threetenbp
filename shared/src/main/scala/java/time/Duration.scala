  * In addition, the {@link ChronoUnit#DAYS DAYS} unit can be used and is treated as
  * exactly equal to 24 hours, thus ignoring daylight savings effects.
  * See {@link Period} for the date-based equivalent to this class.
  *
  * A physical duration could be of infinite length.
  * For practicality, the duration is stored with constraints similar to {@link Instant}.
  * The duration uses nanosecond resolution with a maximum value of the seconds that can
  * be held in a {@code long}. This is greater than the current estimated age of the universe.
  *
  * The range of a duration requires the storage of a number larger than a {@code long}.
  * To achieve this, the class stores a {@code long} representing seconds and an {@code int}
  * representing nanosecond-of-second, which will always be between 0 and 999,999,999.
  *
  * The duration is measured in "seconds", but these are not necessarily identical to
  * the scientific "SI second" definition based on atomic clocks.
  * This difference only impacts durations measured near a leap-second and should not affect
