/** An instantaneous point on the time-line.
  *
  * This class models a single instantaneous point on the time-line.
  * This might be used to record event time-stamps in the application.
  *
  * For practicality, the instant is stored with some constraints.
  * The measurable time-line is restricted to the number of seconds that can be held
  * in a {@code long}. This is greater than the current estimated age of the universe.
  * The instant is stored to nanosecond resolution.
  *
  * The range of an instant requires the storage of a number larger than a {@code long}.
  * To achieve this, the class stores a {@code long} representing epoch-seconds and an
  * {@code int} representing nanosecond-of-second, which will always be between 0 and 999,999,999.
  * The epoch-seconds are measured from the standard Java epoch of {@code 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z}
  * where instants after the epoch have positive values, and earlier instants have negative values.
  * For both the epoch-second and nanosecond parts, a larger value is always later on the time-line
  * than a smaller value.
  *
  * <h3>Time-scale</h3>
  *
  * The length of the solar day is the standard way that humans measure time.
  * This has traditionally been subdivided into 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds,
  * forming a 86400 second day.
  *
  * Modern timekeeping is based on atomic clocks which precisely define an SI second
  * relative to the transitions of a Caesium atom. The length of an SI second was defined
  * to be very close to the 86400th fraction of a day.
  *
  * Unfortunately, as the Earth rotates the length of the day varies.
  * In addition, over time the average length of the day is getting longer as the Earth slows.
  * As a result, the length of a solar day in 2012 is slightly longer than 86400 SI seconds.
  * The actual length of any given day and the amount by which the Earth is slowing
  * are not predictable and can only be determined by measurement.
  * The UT1 time-scale captures the accurate length of day, but is only available some
  * time after the day has completed.
  *
  * The UTC time-scale is a standard approach to bundle up all the additional fractions
  * of a second from UT1 into whole seconds, known as <i>leap-seconds</i>.
  * A leap-second may be added or removed depending on the Earth's rotational changes.
  * As such, UTC permits a day to have 86399 SI seconds or 86401 SI seconds where
  * necessary in order to keep the day aligned with the Sun.
  *
  * The modern UTC time-scale was introduced in 1972, introducing the concept of whole leap-seconds.
  * Between 1958 and 1972, the definition of UTC was complex, with minor sub-second leaps and
  * alterations to the length of the notional second. As of 2012, discussions are underway
  * to change the definition of UTC again, with the potential to remove leap seconds or
  * introduce other changes.
  *
  * Given the complexity of accurate timekeeping described above, this Java API defines
  * its own time-scale with a simplification. The Java time-scale is defined as follows:
  *<ul>
  * <li>midday will always be exactly as defined by the agreed international civil time</li>
  * <li>other times during the day will be broadly in line with the agreed international civil time</li>
  * <li>the day will be divided into exactly 86400 subdivisions, referred to as "seconds"</li>
  * <li>the Java "second" may differ from an SI second</li>
  * </ul><p>
  * Agreed international civil time is the base time-scale agreed by international convention,
  * which in 2012 is UTC (with leap-seconds).
  *
  * In 2012, the definition of the Java time-scale is the same as UTC for all days except
  * those where a leap-second occurs. On days where a leap-second does occur, the time-scale
  * effectively eliminates the leap-second, maintaining the fiction of 86400 seconds in the day.
  *
  * The main benefit of always dividing the day into 86400 subdivisions is that it matches the
  * expectations of most users of the API. The alternative is to force every user to understand
  * what a leap second is and to force them to have special logic to handle them.
  * Most applications do not have access to a clock that is accurate enough to record leap-seconds.
  * Most applications also do not have a problem with a second being a very small amount longer or
  * shorter than a real SI second during a leap-second.
  *
  * If an application does have access to an accurate clock that reports leap-seconds, then the
  * recommended technique to implement the Java time-scale is to use the UTC-SLS convention.
  * <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/utc-sls/">UTC-SLS</a> effectively smoothes the
  * leap-second over the last 1000 seconds of the day, making each of the last 1000 "seconds"
  * 1/1000th longer or shorter than a real SI second.
  *
  * One final problem is the definition of the agreed international civil time before the
  * introduction of modern UTC in 1972. This includes the Java epoch of {@code 1970-01-01}.
  * It is intended that instants before 1972 be interpreted based on the solar day divided
  * into 86400 subdivisions.
  *
  * The Java time-scale is used by all date-time classes.
  * This includes {@code Instant}, {@code LocalDate}, {@code LocalTime}, {@code OffsetDateTime},
  * {@code ZonedDateTime} and {@code Duration}.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
  *
  * Constructs an instance of {@code Instant} using seconds from the epoch of
  * 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z and nanosecond fraction of second.
  *
  * @param seconds  the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
  * @param nanos  the nanoseconds within the second, must be positive and never exceed 999,999,999
