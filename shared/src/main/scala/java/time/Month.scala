/** A month-of-year, such as 'July'.

  * {@code Month} is an enum representing the 12 months of the year -
  * January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October,
  * November and December.
  *
  * In addition to the textual enum name, each month-of-year has an {@code int} value.
  * The {@code int} value follows normal usage and the ISO-8601 standard,
  * from 1 (January) to 12 (December). It is recommended that applications use the enum
  * rather than the {@code int} value to ensure code clarity.
  *
  * <b>Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code Month}.
  * Use {@code getValue()} instead.</b>
  *
  * This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
  * As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the month-of-year
  * concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO-8601 calendar system.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.
