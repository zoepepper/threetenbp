  *
  * {@code MonthDay} is an immutable date-time object that represents the combination
  * of a year and month. Any field that can be derived from a month and day, such as
  * quarter-of-year, can be obtained.
  *
  * This class does not store or represent a year, time or time-zone.
  * For example, the value "December 3rd" can be stored in a {@code MonthDay}.
  *
  * Since a {@code MonthDay} does not possess a year, the leap day of
  * February 29th is considered valid.
  *
  * This class implements {@link TemporalAccessor} rather than {@link Temporal}.
  * This is because it is not possible to define whether February 29th is valid or not
  * without external information, preventing the implementation of plus/minus.
  * Related to this, {@code MonthDay} only provides access to query and set the fields
  * {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_MONTH}.
  *
  * The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
  * in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
  * system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
  * For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
  * However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
  * to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
  *
  * @constructor Constructor, previously validated.
