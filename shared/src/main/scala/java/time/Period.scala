  *
  * This class models a quantity or amount of time in terms of years, months and days.
  * See {@link Duration} for the time-based equivalent to this class.
  *
  * Durations and period differ in their treatment of daylight savings time
  * when added to {@link ZonedDateTime}. A {@code Duration} will add an exact
  * number of seconds, thus a duration of one day is always exactly 24 hours.
  * By contrast, a {@code Period} will add a conceptual day, trying to maintain
  * the local time.
  *
  * For example, consider adding a period of one day and a duration of one day to
  * 18:00 on the evening before a daylight savings gap. The {@code Period} will add
  * the conceptual day and result in a {@code ZonedDateTime} at 18:00 the following day.
  * By contrast, the {@code Duration} will add exactly 24 hours, resulting in a
  * {@code ZonedDateTime} at 19:00 the following day (assuming a one hour DST gap).
  *
  * The supported units of a period are {@link ChronoUnit#YEARS YEARS},
  * {@link ChronoUnit#MONTHS MONTHS} and {@link ChronoUnit#DAYS DAYS}.
  * All three fields are always present, but may be set to zero.
  *
  * The period may be used with any calendar system.
  * The meaning of a "year" or "month" is only applied when the object is added to a date.
  *
  * The period is modeled as a directed amount of time, meaning that individual parts of the
  * period may be negative.
  *
  * The months and years fields may be {@linkplain #normalized() normalized}.
  * The normalization assumes a 12 month year, so is not appropriate for all calendar systems.
