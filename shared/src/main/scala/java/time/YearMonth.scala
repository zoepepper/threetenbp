/** A year-month in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as {@code 2007-12}.
  *
  * {@code YearMonth} is an immutable date-time object that represents the combination
  * of a year and month. Any field that can be derived from a year and month, such as
  * quarter-of-year, can be obtained.
  *
  * This class does not store or represent a day, time or time-zone.
  * For example, the value "October 2007" can be stored in a {@code YearMonth}.
  *
  * The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
  * in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
  * system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
  * For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
  * However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
  * to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
