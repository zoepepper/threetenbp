/** A date expressed in terms of a standard year-month-day calendar system.
  *
  * This class is used by applications seeking to handle dates in non-ISO calendar systems.
  * For example, the Japanese, Minguo, Thai Buddhist and others.
  *
  * {@code ChronoLocalDate} is built on the generic concepts of year, month and day.
  * The calendar system, represented by a {@link Chronology}, expresses the relationship between
  * the fields and this class allows the resulting date to be manipulated.
  *
  * Note that not all calendar systems are suitable for use with this class.
  * For example, the Mayan calendar uses a system that bears no relation to years, months and days.
  *
  * The API design encourages the use of {@code LocalDate} for the majority of the application.
  * This includes code to read and write from a persistent data store, such as a database,
  * and to send dates and times across a network. The {@code ChronoLocalDate} instance is then used
  * at the user interface level to deal with localized input/output.
  *
  *Example: </p>
  * <pre>
  * System.out.printf("Example()%n");
  * // Enumerate the list of available calendars and print today for each
  * Set&lt;Chrono&gt; chronos = Chrono.getAvailableChronologies();
  * for (Chrono chrono : chronos) {
  * ChronoLocalDate date = chrono.dateNow();
  * System.out.printf("   %20s: %s%n", chrono.getID(), date.toString());
  * }
  *
  * // Print the Hijrah date and calendar
  * ChronoLocalDate date = Chrono.of("Hijrah").dateNow();
  * int day = date.get(ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH);
  * int dow = date.get(ChronoField.DAY_OF_WEEK);
  * int month = date.get(ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR);
  * int year = date.get(ChronoField.YEAR);
  * System.out.printf("  Today is %s %s %d-%s-%d%n", date.getChrono().getID(),
  * dow, day, month, year);
  *
  * // Print today's date and the last day of the year
  * ChronoLocalDate now1 = Chrono.of("Hijrah").dateNow();
  * ChronoLocalDate first = now1.with(ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1)
  * .with(ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR, 1);
  * ChronoLocalDate last = first.plus(1, ChronoUnit.YEARS)
  * .minus(1, ChronoUnit.DAYS);
  * System.out.printf("  Today is %s: start: %s; end: %s%n", last.getChrono().getID(),
  * first, last);
  * </pre>
  *
  * <h4>Adding Calendars</h4>
  * The set of calendars is extensible by defining a subclass of {@link ChronoLocalDate}
  * to represent a date instance and an implementation of {@code Chronology}
  * to be the factory for the ChronoLocalDate subclass.
  * </p>
  * To permit the discovery of the additional calendar types the implementation of
  * {@code Chronology} must be registered as a Service implementing the {@code Chronology} interface
  * in the {@code META-INF/Services} file as per the specification of {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}.
  * The subclass must function according to the {@code Chronology} class description and must provide its
  * {@link Chronology#getID calendar name} and
  * {@link Chronology#getCalendarType() calendar type}. </p>
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This abstract class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
  * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
  * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
  *
  * @tparam D the date type
