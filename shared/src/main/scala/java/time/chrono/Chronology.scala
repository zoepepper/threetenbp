    * This returns a {@code Chronology} based on the specified locale,

    * are only returned if they are explicitly selected within the locale.
    *
    * The {@link Locale} class provide access to a range of information useful
    * for localizing an application. This includes the language and region,
    * such as "en-GB" for English as used in Great Britain.
    *
    * The {@code Locale} class also supports an extension mechanism that
    * can be used to identify a calendar system. The mechanism is a form
    * of key-value pairs, where the calendar system has the key "ca".
    * For example, the locale "en-JP-u-ca-japanese" represents the English
    * language as used in Japan with the Japanese calendar system.
    *
    * This method finds the desired calendar system by in a manner equivalent
    * to passing "ca" to {@link Locale#getUnicodeLocaleType(String)}.
    * If the "ca" key is not present, then {@code IsoChronology} is returned.
    *
    * Note that the behavior of this method differs from the older
    * {@link java.util.Calendar#getInstance(Locale)} method.
    * If that method receives a locale of "th_TH" it will return {@code BuddhistCalendar}.
    * By contrast, this method will return {@code IsoChronology}.
    * Passing the locale "th-TH-u-ca-buddhist" into either method will
    * result in the Thai Buddhist calendar system and is therefore the
    * recommended approach going forward for Thai calendar system localization.
    *
    * A similar, but simpler, situation occurs for the Japanese calendar system.
    * The locale "jp_JP_JP" has previously been used to access the calendar.
    * However, unlike the Thai locale, "ja_JP_JP" is automatically converted by
    * {@code Locale} to the modern and recommended form of "ja-JP-u-ca-japanese".
    * Thus, there is no difference in behavior between this method and

/** A calendar system, used to organize and identify dates.
  *
  * The main date and time API is built on the ISO calendar system.
  * This class operates behind the scenes to represent the general concept of a calendar system.
  * For example, the Japanese, Minguo, Thai Buddhist and others.
  *
  * Most other calendar systems also operate on the shared concepts of year, month and day,
  * linked to the cycles of the Earth around the Sun, and the Moon around the Earth.
  * These shared concepts are defined by {@link ChronoField} and are availalbe
  * for use by any {@code Chronology} implementation:
  * {{{
  * val isoDate: LocalDate = ...
  * val thaiDate: ChronoLocalDate[ThaiBuddhistChrono] = ...
  * val isoYear: Int = isoDate.get(ChronoField.YEAR);
  * val thaiYear: Int = thaiDate.get(ChronoField.YEAR);
  * }}}
  * As shown, although the date objects are in different calendar systems, represented by different
  * {@code Chronology} instances, both can be queried using the same constant on {@code ChronoField}.
  * For a full discussion of the implications of this, see {@link ChronoLocalDate}.
  * In general, the advice is to use the known ISO-based {@code LocalDate}, rather than
  * {@code ChronoLocalDate}.
  *
  * While a {@code Chronology} object typically uses {@code ChronoField} and is based on
  * an era, year-of-era, month-of-year, day-of-month model of a date, this is not required.
  * A {@code Chronology} instance may represent a totally different kind of calendar system,
  * such as the Mayan.
  *
  * In practical terms, the {@code Chronology} instance also acts as a factory.
  * The {@link #of(String)} method allows an instance to be looked up by identifier,
  * while the {@link #ofLocale(Locale)} method allows lookup by locale.
  *
  * The {@code Chronology} instance provides a set of methods to create {@code ChronoLocalDate} instances.
  * The date classes are used to manipulate specific dates.
  *
  *  - {@link #dateNow() dateNow()}
  *  - {@link #dateNow(Clock) dateNow(clock)}
  *  - {@link #dateNow(ZoneId) dateNow(zone)}
  *  - {@link #date(int, int, int) date(yearProleptic, month, day)}
  *  - {@link #date(Era, int, int, int) date(era, yearOfEra, month, day)}
  *  - {@link #dateYearDay(int, int) dateYearDay(yearProleptic, dayOfYear)}
  *  - {@link #dateYearDay(Era, int, int) dateYearDay(era, yearOfEra, dayOfYear)}
  *  - {@link #date(TemporalAccessor) date(TemporalAccessor)}
  *
  * <p id="addcalendars">Adding New Calendars</p>
  * The set of available chronologies can be extended by applications.
  * Adding a new calendar system requires the writing of an implementation of
  * {@code Chronology}, {@code ChronoLocalDate} and {@code Era}.
  * The majority of the logic specific to the calendar system will be in
  * {@code ChronoLocalDate}. The {@code Chronology} subclass acts as a factory.
  *
  * To permit the discovery of additional chronologies, the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader}
  * is used. A file must be added to the {@code META-INF/services} directory with the
  * name 'org.threeten.bp.chrono.Chrono' listing the implementation classes.
  * See the ServiceLoader for more details on service loading.
  * For lookup by id or calendarType, the system provided calendars are found
  * first followed by application provided calendars.
  *
  * Each chronology must define a chronology ID that is unique within the system.
  * If the chronology represents a calendar system defined by the
  * <em>Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML)</em> specification then that
  * calendar type should also be specified.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
  * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
  * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
