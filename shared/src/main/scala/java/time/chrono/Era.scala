/** An era of the time-line.
  *
  * Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time-line into two eras.
  * However, some calendar systems, have multiple eras, such as one for the reign
  * of each leader.
  * In all cases, the era is conceptually the largest division of the time-line.
  * Each chronology defines the Era's that are known Eras and a
  * {@link Chronology#eras Chrono.eras} to get the valid eras.
  *
  * For example, the Thai Buddhist calendar system divides time into two eras,
  * before and after a single date. By contrast, the Japanese calendar system
  * has one era for the reign of each Emperor.
  *
  * Instances of {@code Era} may be compared using the {@code ==} operator.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
  * All implementations must be singletons - final, immutable and thread-safe.
  * It is recommended to use an enum whenever possible.
