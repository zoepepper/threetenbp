/** Enumeration of the style of text formatting and parsing.
  *
  * Text styles define three sizes for the formatted text - 'full', 'short' and 'narrow'.
  * Each of these three sizes is available in both 'standard' and 'stand-alone' variations.
  *
  * The difference between the three sizes is obvious in most languages.
  * For example, in English the 'full' month is 'January', the 'short' month is 'Jan'
  * and the 'narrow' month is 'J'. Note that the narrow size is often not unique.
  * For example, 'January', 'June' and 'July' all have the 'narrow' text 'J'.
  *
  * The difference between the 'standard' and 'stand-alone' forms is trickier to describe
  * as there is no difference in English. However, in other languages there is a difference
  * in the word used when the text is used alone, as opposed to in a complete date.
  * For example, the word used for a month when used alone in a date picker is different
  * to the word used for month in association with a day and year in a date.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This is immutable and thread-safe enum.
