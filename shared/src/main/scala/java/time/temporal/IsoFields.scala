/** Fields and units specific to the ISO-8601 calendar system,
  * including quarter-of-year and week-based-year.
  *
  * This class defines fields and units that are specific to the ISO calendar system.
  *
  * <h3>Quarter of year</h3>
  * The ISO-8601 standard is based on the standard civic 12 month year.
  * This is commonly divided into four quarters, often abbreviated as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.
  *
  * January, February and March are in Q1.
  * April, May and June are in Q2.
  * July, August and September are in Q3.
  * October, November and December are in Q4.
  *
  * The complete date is expressed using three fields:
  *<ul>
  * <li>{@link #DAY_OF_QUARTER DAY_OF_QUARTER} - the day within the quarter, from 1 to 90, 91 or 92
  * <li>{@link #QUARTER_OF_YEAR QUARTER_OF_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year
  * <li>{@link ChronoField#YEAR YEAR} - the standard ISO year
  * </ul><p>
  *
  * <h3>Week based years</h3>
  * The ISO-8601 standard was originally intended as a data interchange format,
  * defining a string format for dates and times. However, it also defines an
  * alternate way of expressing the date, based on the concept of week-based-year.
  *
  * The date is expressed using three fields:
  *<ul>
  * <li>{@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK DAY_OF_WEEK} - the standard field defining the
  * day-of-week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7)
  * <li>{@link #WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year
  * <li>{@link #WEEK_BASED_YEAR WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week-based-year
  * </ul><p>
  * The week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year.
  * It differs from the standard year in that it always starts on a Monday.
  *
  * The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard
  * ISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year.
  *<ul>
  * <li>If January 1st is Monday then week 1 starts on January 1st
  * <li>If January 1st is Tuesday then week 1 starts on December 31st of the previous standard year
  * <li>If January 1st is Wednesday then week 1 starts on December 30th of the previous standard year
  * <li>If January 1st is Thursday then week 1 starts on December 29th of the previous standard year
  * <li>If January 1st is Friday then week 1 starts on January 4th
  * <li>If January 1st is Saturday then week 1 starts on January 3rd
  * <li>If January 1st is Sunday then week 1 starts on January 2nd
  * </ul><p>
  * There are 52 weeks in most week-based years, however on occasion there are 53 weeks.
  *
  * For example:
  *
  * <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="3" border="0" style="text-align: left; width: 50%;">
  * <caption>Examples of Week based Years</caption>
  * <tr><th>Date</th><th>Day-of-week</th><th>Field values</th></tr>
  * <tr><th>2008-12-28</th><td>Sunday</td><td>Week 52 of week-based-year 2008</td></tr>
  * <tr><th>2008-12-29</th><td>Monday</td><td>Week 1 of week-based-year 2009</td></tr>
  * <tr><th>2008-12-31</th><td>Wednesday</td><td>Week 1 of week-based-year 2009</td></tr>
  * <tr><th>2009-01-01</th><td>Thursday</td><td>Week 1 of week-based-year 2009</td></tr>
  * <tr><th>2009-01-04</th><td>Sunday</td><td>Week 1 of week-based-year 2009</td></tr>
  * <tr><th>2009-01-05</th><td>Monday</td><td>Week 2 of week-based-year 2009</td></tr>
  * </table>
