/** Common implementations of {@code TemporalAdjuster}.
  *
  * This class provides common implementations of {@link TemporalAdjuster}.
  * They are especially useful to document the intent of business logic and
  * often link well to requirements.
  * For example, these two pieces of code do the same thing, but the second
  * one is clearer (assuming that there is a static import of this class):
  * <pre>
  * // direct manipulation
  * date.withDayOfMonth(1).plusMonths(1).minusDays(1);
  * // use of an adjuster from this class
  * date.with(lastDayOfMonth());
  * </pre>
  * There are two equivalent ways of using a {@code TemporalAdjuster}.
  * The first is to invoke the method on the interface directly.
  * The second is to use {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:
  * <pre>
  * // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
  * dateTime = adjuster.adjustInto(dateTime);
  * dateTime = dateTime.with(adjuster);
  * </pre>
  * It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code with(TemporalAdjuster)},
  * as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This is a thread-safe utility class.
  * All returned adjusters are immutable and thread-safe.
