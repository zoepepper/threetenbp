/** Localized definitions of the day-of-week, week-of-month and week-of-year fields.
  *
  * A standard week is seven days long, but cultures have different definitions for some
  * other aspects of a week. This class represents the definition of the week, for the
  * purpose of providing {@link TemporalField} instances.
  *
  * WeekFields provides three fields,
  * {@link #dayOfWeek()}, {@link #weekOfMonth()}, and {@link #weekOfYear()}
  * that provide access to the values from any {@link Temporal temporal object}.
  *
  * The computations for day-of-week, week-of-month, and week-of-year are based
  * on the  {@link ChronoField#YEAR proleptic-year},
  * {@link ChronoField#MONTH_OF_YEAR month-of-year},
  * {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_MONTH day-of-month}, and
  * {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK ISO day-of-week} which are based on the
  * {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY epoch-day} and the chronology.
  * The values may not be aligned with the {@link ChronoField#YEAR_OF_ERA year-of-Era}
  * depending on the Chronology.
  *A week is defined by:
  * <ul>
  * <li>The first day-of-week.
  * For example, the ISO-8601 standard considers Monday to be the first day-of-week.
  * <li>The minimal number of days in the first week.
  * For example, the ISO-8601 standard counts the first week as needing at least 4 days.
  * </ul><p>
  * Together these two values allow a year or month to be divided into weeks.
  *
  * <h3>Week of Month</h3>
  * One field is used: week-of-month.
  * The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a month boundary.
  * The month is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week.
  * The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days
  * and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days.
  *
  * <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="3" border="0" style="text-align: left; width: 50%;">
  * <caption>Examples of WeekFields</caption>
  * <tr><th>Date</th><td>Day-of-week</td>

  * <td>Week 5 of December 2008</td><td>Week 5 of December 2008</td></tr>
  * <tr><th>2009-01-01</th><td>Thursday</td>
  * <td>Week 1 of January 2009</td><td>Week 0 of January 2009</td></tr>
  * <tr><th>2009-01-04</th><td>Sunday</td>
  * <td>Week 1 of January 2009</td><td>Week 0 of January 2009</td></tr>
  * <tr><th>2009-01-05</th><td>Monday</td>
  * <td>Week 2 of January 2009</td><td>Week 1 of January 2009</td></tr>
  * </table>
  *
  * <h3>Week of Year</h3>
  * One field is used: week-of-year.
  * The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a year boundary.
  * The year is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week.
  * The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days
  * and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days.
  *
  * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
  *
  * @constructor Creates an instance of the definition.
  * @param firstDayOfWeek  the first day of the week, not null
