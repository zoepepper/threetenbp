/** A transition between two offsets caused by a discontinuity in the local time-line.
  *
  * A transition between two offsets is normally the result of a daylight savings cutover.
  * The discontinuity is normally a gap in spring and an overlap in autumn.
  * {@code ZoneOffsetTransition} models the transition between the two offsets.
  *
  * Gaps occur where there are local date-times that simply do not not exist.
  * An example would be when the offset changes from {@code +03:00} to {@code +04:00}.
  * This might be described as 'the clocks will move forward one hour tonight at 1am'.
  *
  * Overlaps occur where there are local date-times that exist twice.
  * An example would be when the offset changes from {@code +04:00} to {@code +03:00}.
  * This might be described as 'the clocks will move back one hour tonight at 2am'.
  *
