  * This class manages the configuration of time-zone rules.

  *
  * Rules are looked up primarily by zone ID, as used by {@link ZoneId}.
  * Only zone region IDs may be used, zone offset IDs are not used here.
  *
  * Time-zone rules are political, thus the data can change at any time.
  * Each provider will provide the latest rules for each zone ID, but they
  * may also provide the history of how the rules changed.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This interface is a service provider that can be called by multiple threads.
  * Implementations must be immutable and thread-safe.
  *
  * Providers must ensure that once a rule has been seen by the application, the
  * rule must continue to be available.
  *
  * Many systems would like to update time-zone rules dynamically without stopping the JVM.
  * When examined in detail, this is a complex problem.
  * Providers may choose to handle dynamic updates, however the default provider does not.
