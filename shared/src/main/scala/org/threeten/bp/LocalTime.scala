    * The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
    * {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS} and {@code HALF_DAYS} are supported.
    * Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
    *
    * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
