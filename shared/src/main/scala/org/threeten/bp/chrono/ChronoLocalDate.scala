/** A date without time-of-day or time-zone in an arbitrary chronology, intended
  * for advanced globalization use cases.
  *
  * <b>Most applications should declare method signatures, fields and variables
  * as {@link LocalDate}, not this interface.</b>
  *
  * A {@code ChronoLocalDate} is the abstract representation of a date where the
  * {@code Chronology chronology}, or calendar system, is pluggable.
  * The date is defined in terms of fields expressed by {@link TemporalField},
  * where most common implementations are defined in {@link ChronoField}.
  * The chronology defines how the calendar system operates and the meaning of
  * the standard fields.
  *
  * <h4>When to use this interface</h4>
  * The design of the API encourages the use of {@code LocalDate} rather than this
  * interface, even in the case where the application needs to deal with multiple
  * calendar systems. The rationale for this is explored in the following documentation.
  *
  * The primary use case where this interface should be used is where the generic
  * type parameter {@code <C>} is fully defined as a specific chronology.
  * In that case, the assumptions of that chronology are known at development
  * time and specified in the code.
  *
  * When the chronology is defined in the generic type parameter as ? or otherwise
  * unknown at development time, the rest of the discussion below applies.
  *
  * To emphasize the point, declaring a method signature, field or variable as this
  * interface type can initially seem like the sensible way to globalize an application,
  * however it is usually the wrong approach.
  * As such, it should be considered an application-wide architectural decision to choose
  * to use this interface as opposed to {@code LocalDate}.
  *
  * <h4>Architectural issues to consider</h4>
  * These are some of the points that must be considered before using this interface
  * throughout an application.
  *
  * 1) Applications using this interface, as opposed to using just {@code LocalDate},
  * face a significantly higher probability of bugs. This is because the calendar system
  * in use is not known at development time. A key cause of bugs is where the developer
  * applies assumptions from their day-to-day knowledge of the ISO calendar system
  * to code that is intended to deal with any arbitrary calendar system.
  * The section below outlines how those assumptions can cause problems
  * The primary mechanism for reducing this increased risk of bugs is a strong code review process.
  * This should also be considered a extra cost in maintenance for the lifetime of the code.
  *
  * 2) This interface does not enforce immutability of implementations.
  * While the implementation notes indicate that all implementations must be immutable
  * there is nothing in the code or type system to enforce this. Any method declared
  * to accept a {@code ChronoLocalDate} could therefore be passed a poorly or
  * maliciously written mutable implementation.
  *
  * 3) Applications using this interface  must consider the impact of eras.
  * {@code LocalDate} shields users from the concept of eras, by ensuring that {@code getYear()}
  * returns the proleptic year. That decision ensures that developers can think of
  * {@code LocalDate} instances as consisting of three fields - year, month-of-year and day-of-month.
  * By contrast, users of this interface must think of dates as consisting of four fields -
  * era, year-of-era, month-of-year and day-of-month. The extra era field is frequently
  * forgotten, yet it is of vital importance to dates in an arbitrary calendar system.
  * For example, in the Japanese calendar system, the era represents the reign of an Emperor.
  * Whenever one reign ends and another starts, the year-of-era is reset to one.
  *
  * 4) The only agreed international standard for passing a date between two systems
  * is the ISO-8601 standard which requires the ISO calendar system. Using this interface
  * throughout the application will inevitably lead to the requirement to pass the date
  * across a network or component boundary, requiring an application specific protocol or format.
  *
  * 5) Long term persistence, such as a database, will almost always only accept dates in the
  * ISO-8601 calendar system (or the related Julian-Gregorian). Passing around dates in other
  * calendar systems increases the complications of interacting with persistence.
  *
  * 6) Most of the time, passing a {@code ChronoLocalDate} throughout an application
  * is unnecessary, as discussed in the last section below.
  *
  * <h4>False assumptions causing bugs in multi-calendar system code</h4>
  * As indicated above, there are many issues to consider when try to use and manipulate a
  * date in an arbitrary calendar system. These are some of the key issues.
  *
  * Code that queries the day-of-month and assumes that the value will never be more than
  * 31 is invalid. Some calendar systems have more than 31 days in some months.
  *
  * Code that adds 12 months to a date and assumes that a year has been added is invalid.
  * Some calendar systems have a different number of months, such as 13 in the Coptic or Ethiopic.
  *
  * Code that adds one month to a date and assumes that the month-of-year value will increase
  * by one or wrap to the next year is invalid. Some calendar systems have a variable number
  * of months in a year, such as the Hebrew.
  *
  * Code that adds one month, then adds a second one month and assumes that the day-of-month
  * will remain close to its original value is invalid. Some calendar systems have a large difference
  * between the length of the longest month and the length of the shortest month.
  * For example, the Coptic or Ethiopic have 12 months of 30 days and 1 month of 5 days.
  *
  * Code that adds seven days and assumes that a week has been added is invalid.
  * Some calendar systems have weeks of other than seven days, such as the French Revolutionary.
  *
  * Code that assumes that because the year of {@code date1} is greater than the year of {@code date2}
  * then {@code date1} is after {@code date2} is invalid. This is invalid for all calendar systems
  * when referring to the year-of-era, and especially untrue of the Japanese calendar system
  * where the year-of-era restarts with the reign of every new Emperor.
  *
  * Code that treats month-of-year one and day-of-month one as the start of the year is invalid.
  * Not all calendar systems start the year when the month value is one.
  *
  * In general, manipulating a date, and even querying a date, is wide open to bugs when the
  * calendar system is unknown at development time. This is why it is essential that code using
  * this interface is subjected to additional code reviews. It is also why an architectural
  * decision to avoid this interface type is usually the correct one.
  *
  * <h4>Using LocalDate instead</h4>
  * The primary alternative to using this interface throughout your application is as follows.
  *<ul>
  * <li>Declare all method signatures referring to dates in terms of {@code LocalDate}.
  * <li>Either store the chronology (calendar system) in the user profile or lookup
  * the chronology from the user locale
  * <li>Convert the ISO {@code LocalDate} to and from the user's preferred calendar system during
  * printing and parsing
  * </ul><p>
  * This approach treats the problem of globalized calendar systems as a localization issue
  * and confines it to the UI layer. This approach is in keeping with other localization
  * issues in the java platform.
  *
  * As discussed above, performing calculations on a date where the rules of the calendar system
  * are pluggable requires skill and is not recommended.
  * Fortunately, the need to perform calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system
  * is extremely rare. For example, it is highly unlikely that the business rules of a library
  * book rental scheme will allow rentals to be for one month, where meaning of the month
  * is dependent on the user's preferred calendar system.
  *
  * A key use case for calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system is producing
  * a month-by-month calendar for display and user interaction. Again, this is a UI issue,
  * and use of this interface solely within a few methods of the UI layer may be justified.
  *
  * In any other part of the system, where a date must be manipulated in a calendar system
  * other than ISO, the use case will generally specify the calendar system to use.
  * For example, an application may need to calculate the next Islamic or Hebrew holiday
  * which may require manipulating the date.
  * This kind of use case can be handled as follows:
  *<ul>
  * <li>start from the ISO {@code LocalDate} being passed to the method
  * <li>convert the date to the alternate calendar system, which for this use case is known
  * rather than arbitrary
  * <li>perform the calculation
  * <li>convert back to {@code LocalDate}
  * </ul><p>
  * Developers writing low-level frameworks or libraries should also avoid this interface.
  * Instead, one of the two general purpose access interfaces should be used.
  * Use {@link TemporalAccessor} if read-only access is required, or use {@link Temporal}
  * if read-write access is required.
  *
  * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
  * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
  * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
  * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
  *
  * Additional calendar systems may be added to the system.
  * See {@link Chronology} for more details.
