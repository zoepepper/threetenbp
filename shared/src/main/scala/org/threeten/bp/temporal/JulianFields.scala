/** A set of date fields that provide access to Julian Days.
  *
  * The Julian Day is a standard way of expressing date and time commonly used in the scientific community.
  * It is expressed as a decimal number of whole days where days start at midday.

  * This is an immutable and thread-safe class.

  /** Julian Day field.
    *
    * This is an integer-based version of the Julian Day Number.
    * Julian Day is a well-known system that represents the count of whole days since day 0,
    * which is defined to be January 1, 4713 BCE in the Julian calendar, and -4713-11-24 Gregorian.
    * The field  has "JulianDay" as 'name', and 'DAYS' as 'baseUnit'.
    * The field always refers to the local date-time, ignoring the offset or zone.
    *
    * For date-times, 'JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' assumes the same value from
    * midnight until just before the next midnight.
    * When 'JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' is applied to a date-time, the time of day portion remains unaltered.
    * 'JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' and 'JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' only apply to {@code Temporal} objects that
    * can be converted into {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY}.
    * A {@link DateTimeException} is thrown for any other type of object.
    *
    * <h3>Astronomical and Scientific Notes</h3>
    * The standard astronomical definition uses a fraction to indicate the time-of-day,
    * thus 3.25 would represent the time 18:00, since days start at midday.
    * This implementation uses an integer and days starting at midnight.
    * The integer value for the Julian Day Number is the astronomical Julian Day value at midday
    * of the date in question.
    * This amounts to the astronomical Julian Day, rounded to an integer {@code JDN = floor(JD + 0.5)}.
